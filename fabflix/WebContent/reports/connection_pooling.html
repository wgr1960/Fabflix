				<p> In this project, we implement connection pooling by first configuring a context.xml file, that is used by the runtime invironment to find 
				the configuration information. This information includes username, password, database name, number of connections, connections number, max wait time and max idle time
				for connections. Every time a user makes a request that needs new information from the database, we use of these connections in the pool, and once
				we are finished we put it back by calling close(). So in fact, connections are not closed like they normally are, but instead reused over and over again.
				Over a long period of time, or number of request, this improves the efficiency of the application significantly. This added to the fact that, Tomcat takes care
				of the minute details of executing connection pooling in the background, without us having to worry about specific details. </p>
